# Toy Redis
This project was made to learn more about redis and improve my Rust skills.

## Features
Toy redis runs a TCP server that `redis-cli` command can directly interface with using the redis serialization protocol.

Some commands implemented are:

1. Ping
2. Echo
3. Set
4. Set with expiration
5. Get
