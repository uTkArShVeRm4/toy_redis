# Toy Redis
This project was made to learn more about redis and improve my Rust skills.

## Features
Toy redis runs a TCP server that `redis-cli` command can directly interface with using the redis serialization protocol.

Some commands implemented are:

1. Ping ![ping](images/Ping.png)
2. Echo ![echo](images/Echo.png)
3. Set and Get ![set](images/Set.png)
4. Set with expiration ![set-ex](images/Set-ex.png)
